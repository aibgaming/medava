Some general OOP & Java Questions:

1. How do we implement interfaces and abstract classes in Java?
2. How do we use exceptions and try-catch blocks to handle errors in Java?
3. What are the benefits of using interfaces in Java and how do they support the abstraction?
4. What are the benefits of using inheritance for abstraction?

Some specific questions I had while I was working through the code:

5. What is the purpose of the Shippable interface and what kind of classes can implement it?
6. Why do we declare that a class implements the Shippable interface and what methods does it need to override?
7. How does the Medicine class inherit the methods and fields from the Shippable interface?
8. What are the implications of declaring the Medicine class as an abstract class?
9. Is the abstract class definitions desirable as compared to implementing them as simple print functions in terms on readibility?
10. Is this implementation the best for performance? In other words, does the abstraction hinder performance in any meaningful manner.
